## Using My Stuff

While you can use my code in your own projects, I would prefer it if you'd credit me and link back to my website. That
way, more people can find my work and hopefully benefit from it. Thanks!

If you do choose to use my code, I'd love to hear what you create with it. Feel free to reach out to me on the
[LibRapid Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cGxTFTgCAC) or create an Issue on GitHub.
